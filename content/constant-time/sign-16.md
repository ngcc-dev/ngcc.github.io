# Constant-time review — 16 Octarine

Scope: reference implementation, representative instance only: `Implementations/Reference_Implementation/Octarine-512/sign.c`. Other instances and optimized implementations have not been proven source-equivalent. This is a source-level triage, not a constant-time certification.

Secret: signing-key polynomials/basis, per-signature masks and sampler state. Public: verification key, algorithm parameters, message and serialized signature.

- Branch/loop trace: `Implementations/Reference_Implementation/Octarine-512/sign.c:230` — The norm check on `w.x[i]` is secret-state-dependent; further checks on `y` and `t0` appear at lines 245–280.
- Table lookups and division/remainder: this source triage does not certify their absence or constant-time compilation. Only the explicitly traced operands above are classified. Public lengths, fixed parameters and verifier checks are not findings.

Assessment: No new vulnerability report is promoted from this representative source triage. A compiler/architecture-specific timing and cache test is still needed before claiming constant-time behavior or exploitable leakage.

Recheck the cited source line and its caller before reusing this result. A timing claim requires controlled same-public-input tests with changed secret state and a public-value control.
